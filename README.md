# ZotReqs

<h4>Inspiration</h4>
As a team of mostly transfer students, the hardest part of adjusting to UC Irvine proved to be the question: What classes can we take? Our counselors provided us with a long list of available classes, but as for specializations and course descriptions, we were absolutely lost.

With ZotReqs, we hope to help fellow students in the following ways:
Allowing them to see what classes they can currently take
Respectively, what classes they can take after those (and so on)
Efficiently planning their next two years at UCI
Reduce stress in adjusting to UCI

<h4>What it does</h4>
ZotReqs is an interactive website where users can list what courses they have taken, and then be shown a graph of what classes they can take.

<h4>How we built it</h4>
Front-end: Javascript (Node, React, Vis)
Back-end: Java, Python, 

<h4>Challenges we ran into</h4>
In three words: originality and experience.

Originality was by far the biggest obstacle. It was difficult coming up with an original yet innovative idea, so we decided to solve a problem relevant to fellow students including ourselves.

There was also a large experience gap. Two of our members learned Javascript from scratch in order to compensate for our lack of front-end knowledge. Meanwhile, the remaining two members put their CS education to work in creating the back-end.

<h4>Accomplishments we are proud of</h4>
We managed to create a working website that people can use to efficiently plan their course schedule for the school year / quarter.

<h4>What we learned</h4>
New languages - We had to learn languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript from scratch in order to contribute to the project.

Teamwork - Dividing tasks up and assigning them based off each of our respective strengths. Additionally, helping each other in a way where all of us learned something new.

<h4>Whatâ€™s next for ZotReqs</h4>
Currently, ZotReqs only supports Computer Science majors. With a little more time, we will be able to add classes for every major in the UC system.

<h4>Built with</h4>
Java, Javascript, Python, vis, bootstrap, jquery
